This is a simple script for analyzing data(stored as a CSV file) for a hydrogen lamp collected with 3 different spectrophotometers (instruments for measuring energy levels of lightwaves) in order to generate a graph of each instruments relative accuracy against the theoretical calculation for Rydberg constant. 

For this analysis we used the fomula described by Bohr's model describing the atomic spectrum for hydrogen.
