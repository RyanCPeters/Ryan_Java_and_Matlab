This is a simple script for analyzing data(stored as a CSV file) for a hydrogen lamp collected with 3 different spectrophotometers (instruments for measuring energy levels of lightwaves) in order to generate a graph of each instruments relative accuracy against the theoretical calculation for Rydberg constant. 

For this analysis we used the fomula described by Bohr's model describing the atomic spectrum for hydrogen.

For references on Rydberg constant and Bohr Model please see the wikipedia article at the following address:

Please note that the .mlx file is easier to understand only if you read it in Matlab's built in editor. So, I've also included the .m file version which is easily read in a basic text editor. There is no functional difference between the two file formats, so they can be treated as equivalent to one another.
