function p = normal(x, mu, sigma)
% p = normal(x, mu, sigma): Computes the probability that a data point is
%                         smaller than x given the data is normally
%                         distributed  with a mean of mu and a standard
%                         deviation of sigma.
%
% inputs: x = The data point to be compared in the normal distribution.
%         mu = The mean of the normal distribution.
%         sigma = The standard deviation of the normal distribution.
%
% outputs: p = The probability that a data point is smaller than x given
%              a normal distribution with mean mu and standard deviation sigma.
